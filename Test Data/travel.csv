"1","What are some Caribbean cruises for October?","<p>My fianc√©e and I are looking for a good Caribbean cruise in October and were wondering which islands are best to see and which Cruise line to take?</p>

<p>It seems like a lot of the cruises don't run in this month due to Hurricane season so I'm looking for other good options.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> We'll be travelling in 2012.</p>

"2","How can I find a guide that will take me safely through the Amazon jungle?","<p>This was one of our definition questions, but also one that interests me personally: How can I find a guide that will take me safely through the Amazon jungle? I'd love to explore the Amazon but would not attempt it without a guide, at least not the first time. And I'd prefer a guide that wasn't going to ambush me or anything :P</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I don't want to go anywhere ""touristy"".  Start and end points are open, but the trip should take me places where I am not likely to see other travellers / tourists and where I will definitely require a good guide in order to be safe.</p>

"4","Does Singapore Airlines offer any reward seats on their EWR-SIN route?","<p>Singapore Airlines has an all-business class flight from EWR-SIN (Newark->Singapore), but I can't seem to find any reward Krisflyer flights for <em>any</em> dates.  </p>

"5","What is the easiest transportation to use throughout Romania for a foreigner?","<p>Another definition question that interested me was: What is the easiest transportation to use throughout Romania for a foreigner?  I plan to visit at some point but I'm still relatively ignorant of how to get about.  I'm particularly interested in more rural areas and the mountains (the difficulty of crossing which I am also ignorant of).</p>

"6","How can I visit Antarctica?","<p>A year ago I was reading some magazine, and found out that there is availability to get a trip to Antarctica.<br>
Unfortunately, there was no info about how I could get there.<br>
Do you know anything about it? Best way to get there, best route, maybe some feedback?</p>

"8","Best way to get from SeaTac airport to Redmond?","<p>Can anyone suggest the best way to get from Seattle-Tacoma (SEA) airport up to Redmond?</p>

<p>I guess one option might be the new tram into the center of Seattle, then try to change onto one of the Express buses out to Redmond (e.g. the 545), assuming you don't have to walk too far to change? Or are you better off trying to stick with buses the whole way?</p>

<p>I'm not keen on the idea of hiring a car to do it, but if a taxi could do it for a sensible price then I might not be averse...!</p>

"9","What are must-visit destinations for the first time trip to Argentina?","<p>We are considering visiting Argentina for up to ten days during mid-to-late December. What would be the top places to see / visit, especially during that time of year?</p>

<p>Secondly, what is the best way to get around in Argentina (e.g. public transport or car rental)?</p>

"10","When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?","<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>

<p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>
