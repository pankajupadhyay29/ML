1,What is spin as it relates to subatomic particles?,"<p>I often hear about subatomic particles having a property called ""spin"" but also that it doesn't actually relate to spinning about an axis like you would think. Which particles have spin? What does spin mean if not an actual spinning motion?</p>
"
2,What is your simplest explanation of the string theory?,"<p>How would you explain string theory to non physicists such as myself? I'm specially interested on how plausible is it and what is needed to successfully prove it?</p>
"
3,"Lie theory, Representations and particle physics","<p>This is a question that has been posted at many different forums, I thought maybe someone here would have a better or more conceptual answer than I have seen before:</p>

<p>Why do physicists care about representations of Lie groups? For myself, when I think about a representation that means there is some sort of group acting on a vector space, what is the vector space that this Lie group is acting on? </p>

<p>Or is it that certain things have to be invariant under a group action?
maybe this is a dumb question, but i thought it might be a good start...</p>

<p>To clarify, I am specifically thinking of the symmetry groups that people think about in relation to the standard model. I do not care why it might be a certain group, but more how we see the group acting, what is it acting on? etc.</p>

7,Will Determinism be ever possible?,"<p>What are the main problems that we need to solve to prove Laplace's determinism correct and overcome the Uncertainty principle?</p>
"
9,Hamilton's Principle,"<p>Hamilton's principle states that a dynamic system always follows a path such that its action integral is stationary (that is, maximum or minimum).</p>

<p>Why should the action integral be stationary? On what basis did Hamilton state this principle?</p>
"
13,What is sound and how is it produced?,"<p>I've been using the term ""sound"" all my life, but I really have no clue as to what sound exactly is or how it is created. What is sound? How is it produced? Can it be measured?</p>
"
15,What experiment would disprove string theory?,"<p>I know that there's big controversy between two groups of physicists:</p>

<ol>
<li>those who support string theory (most of them, I think)</li>
<li>and those who oppose it.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the arguments of the second group is that there's no way to disprove the correctness of the string theory.</p>

<p>So my question is if there's any defined experiment that would disprove string theory? </p>

19,How's the energy of particle collisions calculated?,"<p>Physicists often refer to the energy of collisions between different particles. My question is: how is that energy calculated? Is that kinetic energy?</p>

<p>Also, related to this question, I know that the aim is to have higher and higher energy collisions (e.g to test for Higgs Boson). My understanding is that to have higher energy you can either accelerate them more, or use particles with higher mass. Is this correct?</p>

21,Monte Carlo use,"<p>Where is the Monte Carlo method used in physics?</p>

24,Does leaning (banking) help cause turning on a bicycle?,"<p>I think it's clear enough that if you turn your bicycle's steering wheel left, while moving, and you don't lean left, the bike will fall over (to the right) as you turn. I figure this is because the bike's momentum keeps it moving in the direction you were going, and since your wheels have friction against the ground, the top of the bike moves forward relative to the bottom of the wheels. The top of the bike going north while the bottom of the wheels go northwest will understandable cause you to topple.</p>

<p>So to counteract this and keep you from falling over, leaning into the turn is necessary.</p>

<p>But is there also a causal relationship -- that leaning will <strong>cause</strong> the bike to start to turn? If I start leaning left, I will turn left... but maybe that's because I know that if I don't turn the steering wheel left, the bike will fall over (to the left). I experimented with unruly turns of the steering wheel when I was a kid, and got my scrapes and bruises. Now that I'm a cautious and sedate adult I'm not anxious to experiment that way. :-)</p>

<p>(I also want to ask why airplanes bank into a turn... they don't have the same issues as a bike, i.e. the bottom part has no special friction against the ground. But that would probably make the question too broad.)</p>

26,Velocity of Object from electromagnetic field,"<p>I am wondering if someone could provide me with a formula that would tell me at what velocity a projectile can be launched from something using an electromagnetic field. The idea is much like a rail gun or Gauss rifle, but not exactly.</p>

<p>Just looking to find a formula to determine the speed of the projectile.</p>

<p>Thank you,
Michael Vanderpool</p>
"
27,What is the difference between a measurement and any other interaction in quantum mechanics?,"<p>We've learned that the wave function of a particle collapses when we measure a particle's location. If it is found, it becomes more probable to find it a again in the same area, and if not the probability to finding it in the place that was checked decreases dramatically.</p>

<p>My question is about the definition of measurement. What makes a measurement different from any other interaction between two particles (gravity and EM fields for example)?</p>

<p>In reality, almost every particle interacts with any other particle, so shouldn't there be constant collapse of the wave function all the time? If this happens we're right back in classical mechanics, aren't we?</p>
